**Project Overview:**
The Student Travel Tips website redesign involved transitioning from WordPress to Webflow, building a new site based on a Figma design. The project required a fully customized CMS to manage travel offers and blog content, ensuring the platform remained intuitive for editors while delivering a fresh, responsive design for users.

**Development Process:**

   - Structured CMS collections with categories, tags, and custom fields to allow editors flexibility in managing content.
   - Implemented filtering and search functionalities to enhance user experience when browsing offers and blogs.

3. **Migration from WordPress:**
   - Conducted a content audit to map existing WordPress posts and offers to the new Webflow structure.

4. **Responsive Design:**
