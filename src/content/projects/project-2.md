**Project Overview:**
The Robin’s Hood web app was designed to facilitate seamless collaboration, record-keeping, and communication for businesses. My role focused on UX design and development management to ensure the platform was intuitive, scalable, and efficient. Using a modular design, I prioritized user needs while managing the development process with a database-driven system to track features, bugs, and testing.

**UX Design Process:**

1. **User-Centric Approach:**
   - Conducted research to understand key user workflows, focusing on three main functionalities: record-keeping, project management, and communication.
   - Designed a customizable **dashboard** to provide an overview of critical information, tailored to individual user needs.
   - Developed a modular structure allowing users to enable or disable features, keeping the interface simple and relevant.

2. **Intuitive Navigation:**
   - Created a clear hierarchy for the app’s main modules: Dashboard, Records, Communication, and Directory.
   - Incorporated visual cues and feedback mechanisms to guide users through workflows, reducing the learning curve.

3. **Accessibility and Flexibility:**
   - Ensured the app supported third-party integrations and API connections, allowing businesses to adapt the tool to their specific needs.
   - Designed a privacy-first account system enabling multiple profiles per user, each with distinct permissions and data visibility.

**Development Management:**

1. **Database for Feature Tracking:**
   - Set up a centralized database to document feature requests, their development status, and priority levels.
   - Organized features by module (e.g., Records, Communication) to align with the app’s modular design philosophy.

2. **Bug and Issue Tracking:**
   - Implemented a bug-tracking system linked to the database, enabling the team to log, categorize, and resolve issues efficiently.
   - Categorized bugs by severity and impact, ensuring critical issues were addressed promptly.

3. **Collaborative Development Workflow:**
   - Established a Git-based workflow with version control and branch management for feature development.
   - Conducted regular code reviews to maintain high-quality standards and foster team collaboration.

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Developed a comprehensive testing framework to validate new features and fixes.
   - Scheduled regular user testing sessions to gather feedback on the app’s usability and identify areas for improvement.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Delivered an app with a highly customizable interface, balancing complexity and usability.
- Achieved efficient team collaboration and issue resolution through the database-driven management approach.
- Received positive feedback from stakeholders on the app’s intuitive design and modular functionality.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Framework:** React (for the front end)
- **Design Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD
- **Development Tools:** Git, GitHub
- **Project Management:** Custom database system
- **Hosting:** AWS
