**Hey, I'm Fraser.** I’m a photographer, designer, and creative based in Brighton. My vibe is authentic visuals, thoughtful design, and good energy—whether behind a camera, designing websites, or out on the water sailing.

## What I Do

I shoot events, lifestyle moments, and products—telling genuine stories through my photography. I also craft websites and digital experiences that look good, feel great, and actually work. I love working with tools like **Figma**, **React**, **Astro.js**, and classic **HTML/CSS**.

## Why It Matters

Creating meaningful stuff is important to me. I'm not here to churn out generic work—I want to build projects that resonate, make an impact, and genuinely connect. Every project is an opportunity to create something purposeful.

## Staying Curious

I’m always learning something new—diving deep into tech, exploring design trends, pushing myself at the gym, meditating, or working on my Japanese. Growth keeps me inspired and motivated.

## Real Talk, Real Connections

Good work starts with good conversations. I’m here for genuine collaboration, shared wins, and those late-night creative moments. Let's keep it real and create something amazing together.

## Let's Chat

If you’re after photography that feels true, design that stands out, or just someone who cares about making great work happen—hit me up!

_Let's make something cool._
