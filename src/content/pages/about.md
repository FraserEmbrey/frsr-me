Hello! I'm Fraser, a dedicated product designer and web developer based in the seaside city of Brighton, UK. I specialise in creating intuitive, accessible, and visually compelling digital products that resonate with users and deliver impactful results for businesses.

## Skills and Expertise

I bring a blend of creativity, technical know-how, and user-centred design principles to every project I undertake. My expertise includes:

- **User Experience (UX)**: Wireframing, prototyping, and user research to craft delightful experiences.
- **Web Development**: Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
- **Branding and Visual Design**: Creating logos, style guides, and cohesive brand identities.
- **Problem-Solving**: Conducting market analysis, gap analysis, and devising practical, innovative solutions.

## Approach and Philosophy

I believe in collaboration, clear communication, and a proactive mindset. My approach is grounded in understanding user needs and aligning them with business goals to create designs that are not only functional but also beautiful. Whether it's optimising workflows, designing from scratch, or enhancing existing systems, I strive to exceed expectations.

## Education and Background

- **King's College London**: B.Sc. in Physics and Philosophy, where I honed analytical, research, and technical reporting skills.
- **Brighton College**: A-levels in Physics, Maths, and Philosophy (all Grade A), alongside a strong foundation in STEM subjects.

## Beyond Work

When Iâ€™m not designing, Iâ€™m likely out sailing on the coast, writing short stories, or capturing moments as an event photographer. These hobbies inspire my creative process and add depth to my professional pursuits.
