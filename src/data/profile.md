Web designer, photographer and writer.

I am currently working on freelance projects, please [contact me](mailto:create@frsr.me) if you’d like to work together on a new website or photography project.

Until recently I was working at [Octoply](https://www.octoply.com), designing, building and managing products.

I am an alumnus of [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk), where I studied physics and philosophy.

My spare time is spent [taking photos](https://glass.photo/frsr), writing my blog and sailing.
